## Objective

The default DNS server configured on instances will be the OVHcloud server ( 213.186.33.99 ). You can change this, or add another DNS server. However, the DNS servers are configured automatically with a DHCP server, and you will not be able to change it by editing the resolv.conf file.

This guide explains the procedure to follow in order to change your instance’s DHCP configuration. You can then change your instance’s DNS servers.


## Requirements
- a Public Cloud instance

## Instructions

### For Debian/Ubuntu

- Connect to your instance via SSH. To do this, you can refer to our guide on [Logging in to a Public Cloud instance](../first-login/){.external}.
- Make yourself the root user. To do this, you can refer to our guide on [Becoming the root user and selecting a password](../become_the_root_user_and_select_a_password/){.external}.

>

- Edit the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file with the DNS servers you want.
There are two ways of configuring this:

You can add a DNS server in addition to the one we provide by default.
  
```
supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
```

You can add a DNS server to replace the one we provide by default.
    
```
prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
```
 
- Check that the configuration has been applied properly (this may take several minutes):

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf

domain openstacklocal
search openstacklocal
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 213.186.33.99
```

### For CentOS/Fedora

- Connect to your instance via SSH. To do this, you can refer to our guide on [Logging in to a Public Cloud instance](../first-login/){.external}.
- Make yourself the root user. To do this, you can refer to our guide on [Becoming the root user and selecting a password](../become_the_root_user_and_select_a_password/){.external}.
- Check the current configuration via the nmcli command:

```
nmcli
 
eth0: connected to System eth0
        "Red Hat Virtio"
        ethernet (virtio_net), FA:16:3E:B6:FB:89, hw, mtu 1500
        ip4 default
        inet4 51.77.205.51/32
        route4 0.0.0.0/0
        route4 51.77.205.51/32
        route4 51.77.204.1/32
        inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:feb6:fb89/64
        route6 ff00::/8
        route6 fe80::/64
 
lo: non-managed
        "lo"
        loopback (unknown), 00:00:00:00:00:00, sw, mtu 65536
 
DNS configuration:
        servers: 127.0.0.1 213.186.33.99
        interface: eth0
```
- Find the name of your public interface:

```
nmcli connection show
 
NAME         UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
System eth0  5fb06bd0-0bb0-7ffb-45f1-d6edd65f3e03  ethernet  eth0
```
- Disable automatic DNS modification, and enter the DNS you want:

```
nmcli con mod "Your interface name" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
nmcli con mod "Your interface name" ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1 213.186.33.99"
```
- Apply the configuration:

```
nmcli con down "Your interface name" && nmcli con up "Your interface name"
```
- Check that the configuration has been properly applied:

```
nmcli | grep -E 'DNS|server|interface'
 
DNS configuration:
        servers: 127.0.0.1 213.186.33.99
        interface: eth0
```

### On Windows

- Connect via remote desktop, or via the VNC console. To do this, you can refer to our guide on [Logging in to a Public Cloud instance](../first-login/){.external}.

- Go to network configuration.

![change-dns-servers](images/changednsservers1.png){.thumbnail}

- Then go to your public network adapter’s IPv4 configuration.

![change-dns-servers](images/changednsservers2.png){.thumbnail}

- Add the servers you want to use:

![change-dns-servers](images/changednsservers3.png){.thumbnail}

> [!success]
>
In PowerShell, you can use the nslookup command to check which DNS server is used by default.
