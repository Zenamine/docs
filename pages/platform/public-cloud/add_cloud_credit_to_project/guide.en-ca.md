## Objective

This guide explains how to add credit on to your Public Cloud account using a voucher, or by generating a purchase order.

This will then be used as a default payment method.

Each time a bill is generated, the amount due is debited from your cloud credit, then from your Digital Launch Pad account and loyalty account. The debit balance is then eventually paid using your registered payment method. 

You can find more information on these payment methods in the OVHcloud Control Panel by clicking on your name in the top right-hand corner, then `Payment methods`{.action}.

Cloud credit cannot be transferred or refunded. It does not have any monetary value, and any credit that has not been used within 13 months of purchase will be lost.

## Requirements

* a Public Cloud project


## Instructions

### Buy credit.

To buy Public Cloud credit, go to the `Credits & vouchers`{.action} menu in the Public Cloud section of the OVHcloud Control Panel. Next, click `Buy Public Cloud credit`{.action}.

It will then appear in the credits & vouchers list.

Since validity periods for vouchers are shorter, the voucher will always be used before Public Cloud credit.
