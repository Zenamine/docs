**Last updated 22nd July 2020**

## Objective

The Bring Your Own Image technology (BYOI) enables you to deploy *cloudready* images directly on your dedicated server. You can therefore use the bare metal service as a resource for your deployments.

**This guide explains how to use BYOI through the OVHcloud APIv6.**

## Requirements

- a [dedicated server](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/) in your OVHcloud account
- having your [APIv6 credentials](../../api/first-steps-with-ovh-api/) ready

> [!warning]
>
> A new installation with BYOI will erase all the data on the server.
>

## Instructions

### Technical limitations

There are some technical limitations linked to the use of physical products such as dedicated servers. Here is a non-exhaustive list, to keep in mind during your deployment preparation:

- Boot type : **uefi** or **legacy**
- Partition type :Â **MBR** or **GPT**
- Image format : **qcow2** or **raw**

If your server has a **uefi** boot type, be sure to add an **EFI** partition to your image template.

### Deploying your image

Log in to [https://api.ovh.com/](https://api.ovh.com/){.external} then go to the `/dedicated/server`{.action} section. You can use the `Filter` field to look for  "BringYourOwnImage".

The BYOI feature uses 3 API calls.

To deploy your image, use the following API call and complete the required fields:

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/bringYourOwnImage
>


| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| serviceName | Your server's name. |
| URL | The URL to retrieve your image from. |
| checkSum | Your image's checksum. |
| checkSumType | Your image's checksum type (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512). |
| description | Your image's name. |
| diskGroupId | The disk ID on which you want to install your image. |
| hostname | Your server's hostname. |
| httpHeader | Only if necessary to download your image. |
| sshKey | Your public SSH key. |

| userMetadatas | Meta data used by Nova when booting. |

After you have completed the fields, start the deployment by clicking `Execute`{.action}.

### Checking a deployment

You can track the deployment of your image through the API call below or through the KVM / [IPMI](../use-ipmi-dedicated-servers/).

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/bringYourOwnImage
>

In this example, the deployment is starting.

![GET API call](images/getapicall.png){.thumbnail}

Deployment can take up to 10 minutes. When the operation is complete, your deployment status will change to "done" and your server will be restarted to disk.

### Deleting a deployment

You can choose to remove your deployment by using the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {DELETE} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/bringYourOwnImage
>

This will erase the deployment status and put your server in rescue mode.
