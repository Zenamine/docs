## Objective

OVHcloud Link Aggregation (OLA) technology is designed by our teams to increase your serverâ€™s availability, and boost the efficiency of your network connections. In just a few clicks, you can aggregate your network cards and make your network links redundant. This means that if one link goes down, traffic is automatically redirected to another available link. In this article, we will discuss how to set up OLA in the OVHcloud Manager.

## Requirements

Make sure you have ordered OLA through the OVHcloud Manager prior to following the steps in this guide.

> In order to make any changes to OLA, you will first need to remove any server you are working on from any vRacks to which they are currently attached and remove any attached failover IP.
>

## Instructions

To begin configuring OLA, log into the [OVHcloud Manager](https://ca.ovh.com/manager/){.external}.  Click the **Server** button at the top of the screen then select the server in question from the drop-down menu on the left-hand sidebar. Then click the **Network interfaces** tab. Once you have confirmed that the server is not attached to any vRacks, click the **I have done this, go to the next step** button.

It may take a few minutes for the operation to finish. Once it is done, the next step will be to configure the interfaces in your operating system into a NIC bond or NIC team. To learn how to do this, please check out the following articles for some of the most popular operating systems:
