## Objective

In rescue mode, you can reboot your server on an independent OVHcloud configuration. Your disk can then be mounted like an independent partition.

The advantage of this is that you can carry out tests and make configuration changes when it is most convenient for you, and when it will have the least impact on the operations performed by your server. This also allows you to correct any configuration errors made, which prevented you from accessing the server from the drive.

> If you have any services online, rescue mode will interrupt them as the machine is being rebooted into the OVH rescue environment.

This guide will show you how to reboot your VPS in rescue mode.
