## Preamble
If you want to move your objects from one datacenter to another or even from one project to another, synchronizing objects between containers is the best way to avoid a service disruption during the migration.


### Prerequisites
<<<<<<< HEAD
You need to -  [Prepare the environment for the OpenStack API](../platform/public-cloud/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api/guide.en-ca.md){.ref} by downloading the Swift client. -  Set OpenStack environment variables -  You must have two object containers in two different datacenters

## Configure the synchronization

### Create a synchronisation key
You have to create a key and configure it on each containers, so that the containers can be identified :

- Create the key :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ sharedKey=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```


### Configure the destination container
First, you have to configure the key on the container which is going to receive the data. In this instance, the container is located in BHS.

- Check the region which has been set in the environment variable:


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ env | grep OS_REGION
OS_REGION_NAME=BHS1
```

- Configure the key on the destination container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ swift post --sync-key "$sharedKey" containerBHS
```

- Recover the address of the destination container in order to configure it on the source container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ destContainer=$(swift --debug stat containerBHS 2>&1 | grep 'curl -i.*storage' | awk '{ print $4 }')
```


### Configure the source container
- Change the region in the environment variables :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ export OS_REGION_NAME=GRA1
```

- Configure the key on the source container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ swift post --sync-key "$sharedKey" containerGRA
```

- Configure the destination on the source container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ swift post --sync-to "//OVH_PUBLIC_CLOUD/{zone}/AUTH_account/containerDest" containerGRA
```

### Check the synchronization
After a few moments (depending on the size and number of the files you are uploading) you can check if the synchronization worked by listing the files in each of the containers.

- List the files in the source container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ swift list containerGRA
test1.txt
test2.txt
test3.txt
```

- List the files in the destination container :


```bash
root@serveur-1:~$ swift list containerBHS
test1.txt
test2.txt
test3.txt
```
