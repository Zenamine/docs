## Preamble
Object Storage is a storage solution that is managed primarily through the OpenStack API. However, you might not be familiar with managing storage space via command line. Therefore, we have developed a gateway which makes it possible to connect to your PCA container with an SFTP client.


### Requirements
- SFTP Client : [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php){.external}
- OpenStack Login & Password
- TenantName of the project


## SFTP Client
In this example, we use WinSCP but you can use any SFTP client. Configuration of each SFTP client is similar as explained here regardless of client.


## OpenStack ID
<<<<<<< HEAD
You can generate your OpenStack login & password using this [Guide](../platform/public-cloud/access_console_of_horizon_instance/guide.en-ca.md){.ref}

## TenantName
The TenantName corresponds to the name of your Horizon Project. To get the TenantName, you need to connect to the OpenStack web interface: [https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/](https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/){.external}. Once logged in, the TenantName is visible at the top of page.

## Connection
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Host Name : gateways.storage.<region>.cloud.ovh.net
- User Name : pca
- Password : <TenantName>.<Username_Openstack>.<Password_Openstack>
=======
- Host Name : gateways.storage.{region}.cloud.ovh.net
- User Name : pca
- Password  : {TenantName}.{Username_Openstack}.{Password_Openstack}
- Port      : 22

## Example
If you created a PCA container in sbg1 :

- Host Name : gateways.storage.sbg1.cloud.ovh.net
- User Name : pca
- Password : 971891XXXX1214.f6nBXXXXXAmcv.SfPeASYfuWeqBZgXXXXX2XhF3DY12RkD

## WinSCP Setting
In this part we will disable two WinSCP options :

**Transfer Resume / Transfer to Temporary Filename :** This option will have to be disable because recovery is not possible with PCA and WinSCP can return you an error.

- In the "Endurance" section, select "Disable".

**Preserve Timestamp :** TimeStamp corresponds to the date of modification of the file, we disable it because on PCA we replace this data by the date of upload of the file.

- In the "Transfer" section, click on "Edit...".

- Uncheck "Preserve timestamp".

## Data Recovery
<<<<<<< HEAD
Data recovery requires that the object be unlocked first. A GET request must be made on the object in question. If this command is not made beforehand, your SFTP client will return an error message when attempting to download a file. Consult our guide to learn how to unlock your object [here](../product.en-ca.md){.ref}.
