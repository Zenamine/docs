## Objective

Veeam Backup & Replication is a data protection software. It offers its users a wide range of options for backing up, replicating and restoring their data.

**Find out how to set up a Veeam Backup & Replication server, then register it with an OVHcloud Veeam Enterprise licence server.**


## Requirements

- a Veeam Enterprise solution
- Windows Server 2012 or newer

## Instructions

### Setting up Veeam Backup & Replication

Download the **Veeam Backup & Replication** solution from the official [Veeam website](https://www.veeam.com). You will need to create an account if you do not have one already (account setup is free).

The file is in the *ISO* disk image format. Once you have transferred it onto your server, select the serverâ€™s CD drive, then open the image.

You can then launch the installation wizard on the server. Select `Veeam Backup & Replication (Install)`{.action}.

After you have read the licence agreement, accept the terms and click `Next`{.action}.

![terms conditions](images/veeamBandR_inst_02.png){.thumbnail}

In this step you can specify a licence file. Click `Next`{.action}.

In the step where you select components to install, leave everything unchanged. However, depending on your requirements, you can change the destination path. Confirm by clicking `Next`{.action}.

The installation wizard will then carry out a requirement check. If you are working from a clean Windows installation, some components will be missing, but the installation wizard can download and install them automatically. Confirm by clicking `Next`{.action}.

If missing components have to be installed, wait for the wizard to finish.

### Creating a Veeam Enterprise service account

#### Step 1: Launch a service account

First you will need to generate a **complex** password.

Next, create a service account by entering this command as administrator:

```sh
New-LocalUser "OVHVeeamEnterprise" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "P@ssword01" -Force) -Description "OVHcloud Service Account for Veeam Enterprise" -PasswordNeverExpires:$true -UserMayNotChangePassword:$true -AccountNeverExpires:$true
```

Please note that the account name and password used here are for demonstration purposes, and must be replaced with your own credentials:

- Account name: OVHVeeamEnterprise
- Password: P@ssword01

#### Step 2: Define the service account authorisations

Launch the Veeam console.

![veeam console](images/veeamBandR_use_12.png){.thumbnail}

Verify that it is in **Free Edition** mode, in the bottom right-hand corner.

![free edition](images/veeamBandR_conf_1.png){.thumbnail}

Open the main menu, and click `Users and Roles`{.action}.

![users and roles](images/veeamBandR_conf_2.png){.thumbnail}

In the `Security`{.action} window, click on `Add...`{.action}.

![security](images/veeamBandR_conf_3.png){.thumbnail}

Then, in the "Add User" window, enter the service account name you have created. Select the **Veeam Backup Administrator** role and confirm by clicking `OK`{.action}.

![add admin user](images/veeamBandR_conf_4.png){.thumbnail}

If you go back to the "Security" window, you can check that the account has been properly added.

#### Step 3: Register the Veeam Backup & Replication server

##### **Using the OVHcloud Control Panel**

In your OVHcloud Control Panel, open the `Server` section, then select your service labelled **backupserverenterprise** under `Platforms and services`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar. On this page, click on `Activate licence`{.action} in the `Shortcuts` box.

![control panel register](images/veeam001.png){.thumbnail}

In the new window, enter the following information:

- The public IP address through which your **Veeam Backup & Replication** server can be reached.
- The port of your **Veeam Backup & Replication** server (usually **9392/TCP**).
- The login credentials you have created previously (user name and password).

Validate by clicking `OK`{.action}.

![activation licence](images/veeam03.png){.thumbnail}

Once the activation is complete, you will find the main information on the service page.

##### **Using the OVHcloud API**

First, retrieve your serviceName:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /veeam/veeamEnterprise
>

Then register it:

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /veeam/veeamEnterprise/{serviceName}/register
>

You will need the following information:

- The public IP address through which your **Veeam Backup & Replication** server can be reached.
- The port of your **Veeam Backup & Replication** server (usually **9392/TCP**).
- The login credentials you have created previously (user name and password).

You can obtain the public IP address used by Veeam Enterprise to contact your **Veeam Backup & Replication** server via:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /veeam/veeamEnterprise/{serviceName}
>

#### Step 4: Verify the registration

Launch the Veeam console.

![console veeam](images/veeamBandR_use_12.png){.thumbnail}

Open the main menu and click `License`{.action}.

![open menu](images/veeamBandR_lic_1.png){.thumbnail}
