## Preamble
Public Cloud Archive is a cold storage offer designed to host large volumes of data without any size limit at a very attractive price. Intended for data that is not accessed often, a request must be made in advance and there is a delay prior to recovering data. The time delay will vary depending on the age of data and the frequency of data access.


## Unfreeze your data
When you store data on PCA, data is frozen and can not be recovered directly. You must click on the “Unfreeze” button to begin the recovery process.
