## Preamble
Public Cloud Archive is a cold storage offer designed to host large volumes of data without any size limit at a very attractive price. Intended for data that is not accessed often, a request must be made in advance and there is a delay prior to recovering data. The time delay will vary depending on the age of data and the frequency of data access.


## Unfreeze your data
When you store data on PCA, data is frozen and can not be recovered directly. You must click on the “Unfreeze” button to begin the recovery process.

Once the process has started, a date and time will appear replacing "Frozen". Your file will be available to download once after the mentioned date and time with your browser or with a [Swift/SFTP/SCP client](../pca_sftp/guide.en-gb.md){.ref}.
